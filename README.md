# Portfolio1

In this portfolio project, I am adding to lab 4 which incorporated the menu.
I changed the lab to be a Latin Food Menu, since I myself am Puerto Rican.
I am using CSS to change background colors and fonts. I changed the background color to light purple and
the button color to purple. I also changed the letters to be white and made the button bigger.
For this portfolio I added two new components.
One of my components tells the user how many ntimes they added an item to thier cart.
The second component passes text through to advise users of the nutritional value of the food.
